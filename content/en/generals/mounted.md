In the [Overview][], I explain my thinking.  This is a fairly long article, but
contains a lot of useful background information if you want to understand how I
arrived at these conclusions. If you just want to be told what to do, you can
skip it and dive right in here. 

[Overview]: <{{< relref "overview.md" >}}>

### For Free to Play Players:

You will need to double up with Roland as your main mounted general for both
PVP and monsters.  Give him the following Skill Books:
* Mounted Defense
* Mounted HP
* March Size

For Monster Assistant:
* You will want Li Jing
* Use the following skill books
  * Mounted Attack against Monsters
  * Mounted Defense against Monsters
  * Mounted HP against Monsters

For PVP Assistant:
* As a FTP or light spending player, I strongly recommend that Mounted not
  be your main PVP force, there are no good options for PVP in the FTP
  range.
* Keep your eyes open during events you can win generals for
  * Maximilian I
  * Zhao Yun
  * Basil II
  * If you win one of these Give them the following
    skill books.
    * March Speed
    * Mounted March Speed
    * Mounted Attack

### For Light Spenders

I recommend using periodic events like Advanced Journey until you get
Aethelflaed.  Do as many of these events as you can, you will need many copies
of her.  It will take you longer to fully ascend her, but it is worth it.  She
will be your Monster general.  She must have the following skill books:
* Mounted attack
* Mounted defense against Monsters
* Mounted hp against monsters

Spend enough to get Theodora, she is compatible with Aethelflaed (but not
Roland), and they make a great pair for maximizing your returns on the monsters
you hunt.  You won't be able to take on the absolute biggest monsters quite as
fast, but it is still a highly respectable pair.
* March size
* luck
* either Mounted defense or mounted HP (does not strongly matter which)

For Mounted PVP, use Roland.  See the advice given to FTP players.

As you spend more, consider replacing Theodora with Custer.  You will now be
ready for really big monsters.
