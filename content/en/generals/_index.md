In the [Overview][], I explain my thinking.  This is a fairly long article, but
contains a lot of useful background information if you want to understand how I
arrived at the conclusions in all the other articles. If you just want to be
told what to do, you can skip it and dive right in to which ever more focused
article most interests you.
