In the [Overview][], I explain my thinking.  This is a fairly long article, but
contains a lot of useful background information if you want to understand how I
arrived at these conclusions. If you just want to be told what to do, you can
skip it and dive right in here. 

[Overview]: <{{< relref "overview.md" >}}>

## In General (no pun intended)

As you upgrade your various buildings, many of them allow you to appoint duty
officers.  This is highly advantageous.  In rough terms, there is either

1. a general who specializes in being a duty officer for this building available in the tavern
1. a premium general who specializes in being a duty officer for this building available to win during events
1. a premium general who specializes in being a duty officer for this building available only if you pay thousands of dollars
1. no general at all who specializes in being a duty officer for this building; 

* Where the premium generals exist, the tavern option also generally exists. 
  * The tavern general will often have mixed attributes, some that apply during peace time, and some that apply during PvP
  * The premium general will usually focus more heavily on PvP
  * The premium general may require four gold specialties, five red stars, or both, to truly be stronger than the tavern general.
* Duty generals do _**NOT**_ benefit from skill books.
* Duty generals _**DO**_ benefit from armor, but **ONLY** when appointed as a
  duty officer.  Once appointed, the armor can be removed.  This is very
  important, as it means you can take the set of armor you craft for your wall
  general and cycle it through all your duty generals, saving a TON of time and
  money.
