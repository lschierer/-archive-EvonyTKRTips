In the [Overview][], I explain my thinking.  This is a fairly long article, but
contains a lot of useful background information if you want to understand how I
arrived at these conclusions. If you just want to be told what to do, you can
skip it and dive right in here. 

[Overview]: <{{< relref "overview.md" >}}>

### For Free to Play Players:

This will be the fourth general you look at.  It is lower priority than your
Mounted General, Ranged General, and Wall General.

Trajan will be your main general.  He honestly isn't great, but there are no
better options available to free players.

Trajan must have the Ground HP skill book.

There are NO good free assistants.  You will want to look for a premium
assistant that you can win.  There are a few ways for even free players to do
this, but it is hard.

Look for any of (this is an ordered list, but your options are likely to be
extremely limited, so take what you can get):

* Alessandra (217)
* Maeda Toshiie (214) (I recommend against him in case you become a light spender)
* Guan Yu (206)
* Basil II (199)
* Carus (186)
* Scipio Africanus (184) (I recommend against him in case you become a light spender)
* Alexander the Great (177) (I recommend against him in case you become a light spender)

Keeping in mind the one mandatory skill book above, spread the following 5
skill books between your two generals:
* Ground Troop Attack
* Ground Troop Speed
* Ground Troop Defense
* March Size
* March Speed

For light spenders, stay away from the temptation to invest in Elise.  While
she is theoretically the best ground general out there (by far), that is only
true if you can give her a dragon.  You are likely to only have 2 dragons for a
LONG time - one for ranged, and one for mounted. Elise stinks without a dragon.

I strongly recommend one of the following as your main general:
* Guan Yu (fragments available from the VIP Premium Packages for $50, and from
  events)
* Carus (fragments available fairly regularly if you buy the alliance shop card
  for $20/month)

Look for the following generals as assistant (ordered list):
* Alessandra (217)
* Basil II (199)
* Soult (182)
* Trajan (163) - start with him, but try to avoid investing rune stones and
  replace him when you get someone higher up the list

Follow the same skill book recommendation as the F2P above.
