### The beginning of hunting 

You have read [Getting Started][] and now you are hunting for boss monsters.
While Evony provides bosses in all sorts of sizes for all different sized
keeps, the significant rewards start around the time you can kill a [griffin][]
or a [thief][].  This will be approximately when you get a march that holds
150,000 t10 mounted troops with your monster hunting general pair.  Depending
on how strong your pair of generals is, and on other factors like your monarch
gear, your research, and your blazons, you will *probably* still get wounded.
But it will work, and because it has taken a *very* long time to reach this
point, it will be exciting.

### Next Steps

1. You won't care about your t10s once you have t12s.  
1. When you can train t11s, you do not need more than about 750,000 of them for
   monster hunting.  
   * Train a *few* extra so that you do not have to heal *immediately* if you 
	 do take wounded, but not too many.  If your 750k t11s cannot kill it, then
	 more of them won't help.
   * You will continue to use your t11s as a second, backup, march even after
     you have t12s, and as a third march when you get t13s.
1. Having t12 mounted troops opens up a number of different monsters that have
   been tantalizingly close to killable.  
   * When you get to 800k of them, you have a good solid march.  You can kill a lot.
   * When you get to 900k you can kill more. 
   * When you get to 1m you can kill still more.  However, anything above this
     and you start to get more and more wounded for less and less effect.
   * You may even consider having *two* marches of t12s if you do not care
     about [ghosting][].  
1. Your t13 march is probably just as good as your 900k t12 march when it has
   somewhere between 600k and 700k troops in it.  The author has not fully
   explored the limits of t13s.
