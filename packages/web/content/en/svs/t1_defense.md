So… a little more on t1

T1 gets all of its value from the solid number refines. Without solid number refines t1 is worthless - let me explain further

950+ horse attack on 8 lines for ring and weapon turns the t1 horse attack value into a t10 attack value 

When you do ground 

950+ horse attack x6 refines for ring and weapon makes the horse into a t8
450x2 makes the ground t1 into a t4 ground 

This is where the value comes from. The horse becomes a t8- t10 horse x 100million

The health refines

1800+ horse health x 8 refines between helmet and pants brings the health statistical value up to the equivalent of a t10
If using ground 

1800+ horse health x6 refines is a t8 horse health value 

2500+ x2 make a t4 ground health value

The same with defense
650+ horse refine x8 refines across the chest and boot creates a t10 value.

Without these refines t1 has no value. 

The reason you use t12 archers as the damage part of the defense is because t12 archer have the highest value damage output per rss 

A quick piece of info to think of is that 3 t12 archer at 1000% buff is equal in attack value to 1 T15 archer at 2000% buff… 

I hope this helps everyone understand the importance of the refines in the t1 defense.
